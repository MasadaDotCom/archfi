#Archfi multidisk full disk encryption guide w/ raid-linear mdadm, ZRam lvm2 & luks(1 & 2)

#BEFORE WE BEGIN, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO CHOOSE "SYSTEMD_BOOT" AS THE DEFAULT OR CHOOSING LEGACY LUKS(1), AS GRUB & GRUB 2 HAVE TECHNICAL ISSUES DECRYPTING LUKS2, WHICH IS WHY IN THIS GUIDE WE ARE LEAVING THE BOOT PARTITION ONLY, UNENCRYPTED, INSTEAD OF DETACHED HEADER, OR ENCRYPTED BOOT...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!


Just a simple bash script wizard to install Arch Linux after you have booted on the official Arch Linux install media.

With this script, you can install Arch Linux with two simple terminal commands.

This wizard is made to install minimum packages (Base, bootloader and optionally archdi).

At the end of this wizard, you can install or launch [archdi](https://github.com/MatMoul/archdi) (Arch Linux Desktop Install) to install and configure desktop packages.

You can watch my videos to see how to use it [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytHgIKLV1caHlCrcTSkm5OF2WSVI1_Sq).

## How to use

First, boot with the [last Arch Linux image](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) with a [bootable device](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media).

Then make sure you have Internet connection on the Arch iso. If you have a wireless connection the [`iwctl`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd#iwctl) command might be useful to you. You can also read the [Network configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration) from the Arch Linux guide for more detailed instructions

#(Do this ^ for all disks you wish to merge)



#Modprobe dm-crypt



git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git


#modprobe mdadm


#mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=linear --raid-devices=3 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1


#cryptsetup -y -v -c serpent-xts-plain64be -h whirlpool -s 512 -i 5000 --use-urandom luksFormat /Dev/md0 (for luks, add "...luks --type luks2 /dev/md0 for the newest luks format) 

#cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md0 cryptlvm

#pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm

#vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/cryptlvm

#lvcreate -L +40G vg -n zram0

#lvcreate -L +100G vg -n root

#lvcreate --extents +95%FREE vg -n home


DO NOT ADD A FILESYSTEM TO LOGICAL VOLUMES OR LEAVE LOGICAL MOUNTED WHEN YOU BOOT INTO ARCHFI, ARCHFI WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROPERLY MOUNT THEM, AND YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GENERATE FILESYSTEM HOOKS!


#modprobe zram

#echo lz4 > /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm

#echo 40G > /sys/block/zram0/disksize

#mkswap --label zram0 /dev/mapper/vg-zram0

#swapon --priority 100 /dev/mapper/vg-zram0

#swapoff /dev/mapper/vg-zram0


#Then download the script with from the command line:

    curl -LO archfi.sf.net/archfi

If SourceForge is down, use this instead:

    curl -LO matmoul.github.io/archfi

#Finally, launch the script:

    sh archfi


#--- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE BTRFS FILESYSTEM AS IT IS NOT FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH ANY VERSION OF RAID!---

once you reach disk partitioning/mounting, use only /dev/mapper/vg-{example_logical-volume}...for all but boot/efi partition (ex. SDA1) otherwise archfi will delete the raid, lvm & luks partitions, and you'll have to start over, as archfi is not locally compatible with lvm, custom encryption or raid filesystems.

#MOUNT /DEV/SDA1 @ /BOOT [FAT32,EXT4]

#MOUNT /DEV/MAPPER/VG-ZRAM0 @ SWAP [SWAP]

#MOUNT /DEV/MAPPER/VG-ROOT @ ROOT [EXT2,EXT3, EXT4]

MOUNT /DEV/MAPPER/VG-HOME @ HOME [EXT2, EXT3, EXT4]


Make sure you choose "DOS, DMRAID, LVM & REISERFS" WHEN PROMPTED TO CHOOSE A FILESYSTEM, following Mkinitcpio refresh, choose at least "Linux" on this page, DO NOT CHOOSE HARDENED, ZEN, LTE SOLELY YET! you may choose a different header later on in the installation.

----PLEASE NOTE, YOU MAY NEED TO EDIT THE FSTAB, CRYPTTAB & GRUB CONF, BY PRESSING "EDIT" THIS BASH SCRIPT, WAS NOT MADE FOR THIS AMOUNT OF CUSTOMIZATION, IT WAS INTENDED TO BE QUICK & EASY, THEREFORE IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AN EXPLOIT, TO BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE IT THIS MUCH, BUT AGAIN, ITS NOT PERFECT AS IT WASNT DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE-----


Notice/credits~ I apologize for any confusion in this guide,as I normally don't use GitHub for anything other than downloading, and despite the flaws, that need to be overcame to make my guide work, archfi is truly the best, despite lack of customization outside of point & click, if it wasn't for mat, I would not have become so into Arch, and currently Gentoo, and I'm posting this guide, to help others like myself, who wanted an an easy fde install, as well as to show my appreciation to Mat & his team for this simple script, that changed my outlook, and life to be frank, all credits go to Mat & the Archfi team.



Should you have issues unlocking grub post install, you may need to reinstall via running "sudo curl -LO archdi.sf.net/archdi" followed by "sudo sh archdi" (second half of this installer, to fix the build HOOKS.


Then follow the on-screen instructions to completion.


If you require extra help, visit the provided video playlist and follow my example.

## More custom install

    sh archfi -cpl {URL of your custom package list}

You can find a sample custom package list file in the samples folder.

## For developers

You can test your script with this command :

    sh archfi -t {githubusername} {branchname}

Alternatively if you wish to install manually, but don't want to install all the packages base post Install...
"archdi.sf.net/archdi"

Example :

    sh archfi -t matmoul master
